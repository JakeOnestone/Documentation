# Radicale
Radicale is "A Free and Open-Source CalDAV and CardDAV Server":  
<https://radicale.org>  
<https://github.com/Kozea/Radicale>

And that's exactly why I installed it: To manage my appointments and contacts on my own home server.

Problems I had:
*   In the repositories was version 1.x, but I wanted a (more) current version.
*   That's why more had to be set up by hand than I hoped
*   There was a big change from 1.x to 2.x, so some sources are out of date.
