# Documentation
A collection of instructions, notes, procedures, best practices, ...

In my experience, one of the biggest problems with using new software is the setup.
Even if there are (more or less) good instructions, it usually takes a few hours for everything to work as intended and often, the information from different sources must be combined.

In this repository, I collect my procedures and thoughts that eventually made me achieve my goal.
If you use the same software/project/whatever you will find here the steps that worked for me.
However, since your requirements and configuration may differ from mine, I can not guarantee that they will be successful with you.
Read the steps carefully and apply them with common sense; and if they don't work, there is usually more detailed information elsewhere.

But I personally find it very convenient to see how it works for others, that's why I publish mine for you.
